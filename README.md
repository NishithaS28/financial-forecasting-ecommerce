# Financial Forecasting Model for E-Commerce

This repository contains a forecasting model designed to predict revenue trends for an e-commerce platform. The project utilizes time series forecasting models to analyze sales data and provide insights for future sales trends.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a forecasting model that improves the accuracy of revenue predictions using historical sales data. The project integrates advanced time series forecasting techniques such as ARIMA and Prophet, along with SQL-based data preprocessing.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Prophet, ARIMA)
- SQL (for data preprocessing)
- Tableau (for visualization)

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Python script `forecasting_model.py` to generate revenue forecasts.

## Results
- 20% improvement in forecasting accuracy
- Visualizations built in Tableau to show predicted vs. actual revenue
